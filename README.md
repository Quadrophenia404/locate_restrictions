locate_restrictions
===================

This script takes in a DNA segment with get_FASTA.py and prints the position and length of each restriction site in the DNA segment.  Reverse compliments are found by calling Reverse_Compliment.py.

An additional for loop is used within the script to allow for multiple DNA segments to be processed from the dictionary returned by get_FASTA.py.
